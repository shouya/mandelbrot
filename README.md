# Why this is
I like fractal pics. That's the reason.

Further, I am trying few graphical libs for a formal game programming
with [rix](http://rixtox.com), and I then wrote the zoom-able version
for a short trial.

# Limitation
Precisions hurt. As the zoomable version shows, the uncertainty is being
unacceptable since the zoom level reach 16.0x.

# Usage
Two programs are there:
## Zoomable
Requirement:
	- gem: rubygame

Then run:
```bash
ruby navigator.rb
```

## Picture generator
Requirement:
	- gem: rmagick

Run:
```bash
ruby mandelbrot.rb
```
